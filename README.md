# FiboClockcciâ„¢

A virtual take on the [Fibonacci Clock](http://geekoclock.com/) using Vue, Vuex and Moment to create a way to tell time that would make Leonardo Bigollo himself beam with pride.

Reading the clock is simple. Add the red and blue squares for hours. Add the green and blue squares and multiply by five to get the minutes.

Time zone features are coming soon as well as styling enhancements.
